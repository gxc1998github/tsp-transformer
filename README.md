# TSP Transformer

### Overview
This project adapts the Transformer model to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). It is designed to be run on Google Colab, making setup straightforward and leveraging Colabâ€™s GPU for efficient processing.

### Description
The project is based on *"The Transformer Network for the Traveling Salesman Problem"* by Xavier Bresson and Thomas Laurent.

| `experiment_TSP50.ipynb`         | Main use for experiments and results analysis on the parameters optimisation |
| `visualization_TSP50.ipynb`      | For testing the current checkpoint trained model of TSP50 
| `visualization_TSP100.ipynb`     | For testing the current checkpoint trained model of TSP100 

### Getting Started

To set up and run this project in Google Colab, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Download the Project Files
1. Download the entire `TSP_Transformer` folder as a ZIP file from the repository or using the download option on GitHub.
2. Extract the ZIP file to a location on your computer.

#### Step 2: Upload the Files to Google Drive
1. Open [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) in your browser.
2. Upload the extracted `TSP_Transformer` folder to the root of your Google Drive.

#### Step 3: Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab
1. Navigate to the `TSP_Transformer` folder in Google Drive.
2. Locate the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) you want to run (e.g., `visualization_TSP50.ipynb`).
3. Right-click on the notebook file, select **Open with**, and choose **Google Colab**.

#### Step 4: Connect Google Colab to Google Drive
1. In Google Colab, run the first code cell in the notebook to mount your Google Drive:
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```
2. This step will grant Colab access to your Google Drive files, allowing it to read the project files from the `TSP_Transformer` folder.

#### Step 5: Follow Notebook Instructions
Each notebook contains sequential instructions to:
- Set up the environment
- Train the Transformer model on TSP data if using new imported data
- Test model performance and visualize results if using existing checkpoints

Proceed through the cells in the notebook, following the prompts to complete each step.
